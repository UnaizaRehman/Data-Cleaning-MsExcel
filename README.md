# Data-Cleaning-MsExcel
📌 Project Title:
Excel Data Cleaning & Dashboard Visualization

📂 Description:
This project involves working with a dataset containing over 1000+ records, where the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to prepare the data for analysis by addressing quality issues and then presenting key insights through an interactive dashboard.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps:
Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed all duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Abbreviation Fixes: Standardized inconsistent abbreviations (e.g., "NY" → "New York", "Mgr" → "Manager") for clarity and consistency.

Data Type Correction: Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., dates, currency, numeric, text) to enable accurate filtering and analysis.

📊 Data Analysis & Visualization:
Pivot Tables: Created multiple pivot tables to summarize the data by categories such as region, department, date, and performance metrics.

Dashboard: Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using charts (bar, pie, line) to present key KPIs.

Slicers: Added slicers to allow users to filter data dynamically by category, date range, or other attributes.

📁 Files Included:
Cleaned_Dataset.xlsx – The final cleaned dataset with pivot tables and dashboard.

Raw_Data.xlsx – Original uncleaned dataset.
